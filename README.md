# AutomationScripts
## Simple scripts for simple tasks

I will keep adding more scripts for all the boring things I don't really want to do manually. <br>
I hope this helps someone make their experience a bit more convenient

### HOW TO RUN
- Download Python 3.11 from the official Python website
- Download the zip file of scripts and unzip it, or clone the repository
- Open a terminal window in the folder with the scripts
- Run `python3 scriptExecutor.py`
- Leave terminal open, it will keep scanning your Downloads folder
